	<h1>Omni EULA</h1>

	<h4>What does my license cover?</h4>
	<p>You can use your license to unlock Omni on a single Windows computer for a period of 1 year.</p>

	<h4>How do you process my purchase?</h4>
	<p>We accept Paypal or SWIFT payment.</p>
	<p>For PayPal, after you email us for requesting a license, we will send you a PayPal payment request. After we receive the payment confirmation we will send you your license key.</p>

	<h4>Why don't you offer refunds?</h4>
	<p>
		There's no way to easily "turn off" a serial number once it's been issued. If I offered refunds, people could just buy a license, unlock the app and then request a refund. They'd get their money back and still have an unlocked copy of the app.
		We offer a lengthy free-trial period so it's easy to decide if you want the app before you buy a license. For these reasons, all sales are final.
	</p>

	<h4>What information does Omni exchange in its internet traffic?</h4>
	<p>
		No sensitive information, that is granted. 
		These are all the situations Omni will do internet traffic:
		<ul>
			<li>Loading home page news</li>
			<li>Loading Playground pages</li>
			<li>Activating your software when you submit your license information</li>
			<li>Checking if an updated Omni version is available</li>
			<li>When the .html page you load in Omni requests some internet resource (images, AJAX, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<hr />

	<h4>EULA</h4>
	<p>I realize that Omni only runs on Windows 7+. I agree not to hold Ramon F. Mendes or MI Software liable for any damages caused by the app. I also understand that refunds aren't possible.</p>
